## Breast Cancer Prediction

### Objective

This project aims to develop a predictive model for the classification of breast cancer, distinguishing between benign and malignant cases. Additionally, the model provides the ability to classify whether a patient has benign cancer or not (Yes/No).

### Workflow

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - The dataset is sourced from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer database available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
   - The dataset comprises 699 cases, with 458 (65.5%) classified as benign and 241 (34.5%) as malignant cases.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Explore and preprocess the dataset, extracting relevant features for building an effective predictive model.

3. **Building/Training/Validation/Test Samples:**
   - Create distinct samples for training, validation, and testing to ensure robust model performance and evaluation.

4. **Model Selection:**
   - Explore a variety of machine learning models for breast cancer prediction, including:
     - K-Nearest Neighbors
     - Logistic Regression
     - Stochastic Gradient Descent
     - Na√Øve Bayes
     - Decision Tree Classifier
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assess the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


### Results

Explore the model performances and compare the results achieved by different algorithms in predicting breast cancer classifications.

### Future Work
